# linear-regression
In this program I have pre-processed a data file from the numbers site of the budgets and revenues made by movies I have only used two parameters the dependent variable is the production budget and the independent variable which I have used is revenue.

## Training-parameters
After pre-processing the data I finally use the cost folder and import linear regression and check its accurecy as I have used only one feature so the accurecy is just 55% but it tells us a lot about how linear regression works and I have used a few charts to help you in visualization
